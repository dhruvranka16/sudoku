## Introduction

The Sudoku Solver website provides a user-friendly interface to solve Sudoku puzzles. It utilizes the backtracking algorithm, a common technique used to solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently. With this website, users can input their Sudoku puzzle and receive the solution in real-time.

## Features

- User-friendly interface: The website provides an intuitive interface for users to input their Sudoku puzzle easily.
- Real-time solving: Once the puzzle is entered, the solver algorithm starts solving it in real-time, and the solution is displayed instantly.
- Clear functionality: Users can easily clear the input to start afresh or enter a new puzzle.

## Usage

To use the Sudoku Solver website, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. You will see a 9x9 grid representing the Sudoku board.
4. Enter the numbers of the puzzle into the respective cells. For empty cells, leave them blank.
5. Once the puzzle is entered, the solver algorithm will start solving it, and the solution will appear in real-time.
6. To clear the board and enter a new puzzle, click the "Clear" button.

## How It Works

The Sudoku Solver website uses the backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. Here is a high-level overview of how the solver works:

1. The solver starts by finding an empty cell on the Sudoku board. If no empty cell is found, it means the puzzle is solved.
2. For the empty cell, it tries all numbers from 1 to 9.
3. For each number, it checks if it is valid to place in the current cell. It verifies if the number already exists in the same row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid.
4. If the number is valid, it is placed in the current cell, and the solver proceeds to the next empty cell.
5. If the number is not valid or all numbers have been tried, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries the next number.
6. The process continues until a valid solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.

The website provides a visual representation of the solving process, allowing users to see how the algorithm works step by step.
